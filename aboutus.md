##Chorus History
####The formation of what eventually became the Mammoth Cave Chapter began in the spring of 1971 at a meeting in Glasgow, Kentucky called by Society Field Representative, Chet Fox. The 12 men at the meeting elected Marvin Nicholson president of what was proposed to be the Glasgow-Barren County Chapter. Nicholson had previous barbershop experience as a member of the old Versailles, Kentucky Chapter.

####Bill Boone, the choral director at Glasgow High School, agreed to be the new group's first musical director despite the fact that he had no previous barbershop experience. The proposed name for the as yet unlicensed chapter chorus was the "Highlander" chorus. By the summer of 1972, after several public performances under Boone and successor John Malone (a senior at nearby Western Kentucky University), the men from Glasgow and Barren County were joined by approximately 10 ex-barbershoppers from a failed chapter in Bowling Green, about 35 miles west of Glasgow and the site of Western Kentucky University with the solid contingent from Bowling Green now in the fold, along with about seven or eight others from various towns in the Southern Kentucky area, it was decided to pursue the name "Mammoth Cave Chapter" with the Society in order to reflect the concept of membership.

##Barbershop Music
####Barbershop vocal harmony is a style of a cappella, or unaccompanied vocal music characterized by consonant four-part chords for every melody note. Each of the four parts has its own role: generally, the lead sings the melody, the tenor harmonizes above the melody, the bass sings the lowest harmonizing notes, and the baritone completes the chord, usually below the lead. The melody is not usually sung by the tenor or bass, except for an infrequent note or two to avoid awkward voice leading, in tags or codas, or when some appropriate embellishment can be created.

##Message from the Director
####We’re glad to have you here at the Caveman Chorus’ web site.  We’re very proud of it.  Whether you’re a prospective barbershop chorus singer, a current or former “Caveman”, or simply one who is interested in learning more about barbershop harmony, you should find the site interesting and informative.

<p></p>

####I’m Greg Hollander, musical director and long-time Caveman Chorus member.  I began singing with the Mammoth Cave Chapter of the Barbershop Harmony Society in 1983.  Through the years, the Caveman Chorus has provided an opportunity for me to enjoy a wonderful hobby, and has taught me many things.  I’ve learned how to become a better singer and how vocal harmony can sharpen a person’s skills and instincts as a musician.  The group has given me a chance to develop my skills as an arranger and performer, both in quartet and chorus situations.  It has been a great creative outlet.  I’ve also learned that the guys in the Caveman Chorus are some of the most outstanding members and contributors of their respective communities.  They’ve become my best friends over the years and I value all of these friendships tremendously.

<p></p>

####But one of the things that has made me most proud of my years of dedication to the chorus is that I’m now the older half of a two-generation duo within our ranks.  My son Erick, is one of the newer members of the chorus and I’m hoping that barbershop music will become a life-long source of enjoyment for him, as it has been for me.  

<p></p>

####Please let us know if you’ve enjoyed visiting us here in the Caveland cyber-world.  Stop by and visit us in Bowling Green if you ever have the chance.  We’d love to share our hobby with you. 

<p></p>
