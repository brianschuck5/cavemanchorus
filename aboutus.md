##Chorus History
####The formation of what eventually became the Mammoth Cave Chapter began in the spring of 1971 at a meeting in Glasgow, Kentucky called by Society Field Representative, Chet Fox. The 12 men at the meeting elected Marvin Nicholson president of what was proposed to be the Glasgow-Barren County Chapter. Nicholson had previous barbershop experience as a member of the old Versailles, Kentucky Chapter.

####Bill Boone, the choral director at Glasgow High School, agreed to be the new group's first musical director despite the fact that he had no previous barbershop experience. The proposed name for the as yet unlicensed chapter chorus was the "Highlander" chorus. By the summer of 1972, after several public performances under Boone and successor John Malone (a senior at nearby Western Kentucky University), the men from Glasgow and Barren County were joined by approximately 10 ex-barbershoppers from a failed chapter in Bowling Green, about 35 miles west of Glasgow and the site of Western Kentucky University with the solid contingent from Bowling Green now in the fold, along with about seven or eight others from various towns in the Southern Kentucky area, it was decided to pursue the name "Mammoth Cave Chapter" with the Society in order to reflect the concept of membership.

##Barbershop Music
####Barbershop vocal harmony is a style of a cappella, or unaccompanied vocal music characterized by consonant four-part chords for every melody note. Each of the four parts has its own role: generally, the lead sings the melody, the tenor harmonizes above the melody, the bass sings the lowest harmonizing notes, and the baritone completes the chord, usually below the lead. The melody is not usually sung by the tenor or bass, except for an infrequent note or two to avoid awkward voice leading, in tags or codas, or when some appropriate embellishment can be created.
